abstract: This paper examines the effect of birth order on educational attainment and its mechanism in the United States. Using a family fixed effects model, we find negative birth order effects, which are in line with previous research among developed countries. Turning to the mechanism behind the birth order, this paper evaluates if the resource dilution model would be a plausible pathway by exploiting parental income during childhood. This theory states that parental resources are finite, and as the number of children in a family increases, the resources devoted to them decline. Among poorer households, the first-born child may pursue labor market opportunities at a younger age reducing their educational attainment, which reverses the birth order effects. Our results show significant negative birth order effects among wealthy households and insignificant effects among low-income households. This suggests that the resource dilution hypothesis is a plausible mechanism behind the birth order effects.
