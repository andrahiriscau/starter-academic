abstract: I analyze the effect of two maternity leave (ML) reforms on family living arrangements using regression discontinuity and differences-in-differences methodology. The first reform extended ML from 60 days to one year and provided 65% of the mother’s income before childbirth. It did not significantly impact family living arrangements. The second reform extended ML from one year to two years and provided 85% of the mother’s income. It increased the probability that the mother was single at the time of birth. Results from the second reform support the independence hypothesis, an increase in women’s income reduces the need to pool resources and makes household work specialization less advantageous, leading to a higher probability of single motherhood.
