abstract: This study examines how paid maternity leave (ML) impacted fertility and mothers' labor force participation in Romania. Specifically, I investigate the effects of a law regarding paid ML, which was implemented in 1990- less than one month- after the fall of the Communist regime in the country. The ML gives mothers the right to paid leave until the child turns one year old, and it offers 65% of monthly income before birth. This policy change was unexpected, creating conditions for a quasi-natural experiment. To establish causality, I examine the effects of this policy change using a regression discontinuity design and census data. I show that mothers who are eligible for ML are 3 percentage-points more likely to have an additional child than those ineligibles. The effect is persistent for seven years after the policy was implemented. I find no significant results regarding the motherâ€™s labor force participation. I argue that the policy alleviated, to some extent, declining fertility rates, which were primarily caused by lifting bans on birth controls after the fall of the communist regime. These results have important implications regarding the shrinking working-age population and the ability to fund benefits programs.
